#### Sending a sample gRPC location data request to the Location Ingester Service

The gRPC proto used is location.proto and it has the following structure:
message LocationMessage {
  int32 person_id = 1;
  string latitude = 2;
  string longitude = 3;
}

The sample_writer.py script sends a sample gRPC location data request to the Location Ingester Service.
The script uses the location.proto file to create a LocationMessage object and sends it to the Location Ingester Service using the gRPC protocol.

In order to do this, start a shell session in the `udaconnect-location-ingester` pod and run the following command to send a sample gRPC location data request to the Location Ingester Service:

```bash
# Retrieve the pod name for the udaconnect-location-ingester service
kubectl get pods

# Start a shell session in the udaconnect-location-ingester pod
kubectl exec -it <POD_NAME> sh

# Run the following command to send a sample gRPC location data request to the Location Ingester Service
python sample_writer.py
```

Once this is done, you should be able to see the location data being ingested in the `udaconnect-location-service` pod logs.

```bash
kubectl logs -f <LOCATION_INGESTER_POD_NAME>
kubectl logs -f <LOCATION_SERVICE_POD_NAME>
```
